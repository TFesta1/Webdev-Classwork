## Web Dev Spring2023

I’m a second semester Junior Computer Science student. I have experience with programming languages such as java, JavaScript, html/css, SQL, and python. I have taken computer science I, II, III, as well as assembly, software engineering, object oriented programming, and digital logic. I’ve worked on programs, such as a website for the Humans Versus Zombies club to have a login system and keep all their data for the game in one place, and a min-max algorithm for an “escape the pig” game resembling cool-math games. I have collaborated on a dungeon game within unreal engine where I was responsible for saving the game state.

I see myself further using the course material within the job realm. For instance, my internship over the summer will be using React, and if we’re not using that here, it will be similar. Nonetheless, jobs always are requesting for software development skills, which this can be directly used for. Even within my free time, there can be ventures for which people may be requesting maintenance or the development for a project, which I will hopefully further develop the skills to do.
	
One thing I would like to help make my semester flow easier is to give fully honest and developmental feedback whenever I periodically present my current progress to you towards my assignment. I believe we’ll be continuously working on a website for the duration of the course, and I’ll thus continuously work on this in and out of class. Thus, I would want to just make sure that I’m not getting stuck and always moving in the right direction.
